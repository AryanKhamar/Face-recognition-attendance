# Face Recognition Based Attendance System 🎓🧠

A smart and efficient attendance system using **face recognition technology**. 
This Python-based project utilizes OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to automate and digitize the attendance-taking process, 
reducing human effort and minimizing chances of proxy or error.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Real-time face detection and recognition via webcam
- 📸 Capture and store images of new students/employees
- 🗂 Maintains attendance logs in CSV format
- 🧾 Displays time and date of attendance
- 🔒 Prevents duplicate entries in a single session
- 🧠 Uses pre-trained deep learning model (`dlib`) for face encoding
  
## 🛠 Technologies Used
- OpenCV 📷
- face_recognition (built on dlib) 🧠
- NumPy 📊
- Pandas 📄

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. Then install the required packages:
